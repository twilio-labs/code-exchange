1. File bugs with respect to either template applications or the general website
2. Request new templates for use cases
3. Submit a request to have your own app added to [Code Exchange][codeexchange]
4. Learn about the [coding guidelines][guidelines] we use for our respective applications

## Contributing to Code Exchange

We built [Code Exchange] for the community and want to allow you all to be a part of it.

There are different ways you can contribute to Code Exchange:

### 1. Contribute functionality or fix issues for existing applications

Every sample you find on [Code Exchange] is open-source and welcomes contributions. Click the `View on GitHub` button on the respective sample and you'll be redirect to the respective repository.

From there make sure to inspect the `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (if available) and any open issues before you get started.

### 2. Contribute to Twilio Function templates

Some of the samples on [Code Exchange] are samples written for [Twilio Functions](https://www.twilio.com/runtime/build) a serverless JavaScript environment that's part of the [Twilio Runtime](https://www.twilio.com/runtime). You can identify these samples by their `Host on Twilio` label.

All of these samples are hosted in one single repository called [twilio-labs/function-templates](https://github.com/twilio-labs/function-templates). Check out the project's [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/twilio-labs/function-templates/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for concrete ways to contribute to that project.

### 3. Add your own application to Code Exchange

If you already have an application or are planning to build an application that you'd like us to feature on [Code Exchange], please follow the following steps.

#### Step 0 [optional]:

If you haven't yet, this is a good place to start working on your application code.

#### Step 1:

Head over to our [Code Exchange Community Program page][community] and review our [Twilio Code Exchange Community Program Agreement][agreement]. Once you've reviewed it, make sure you [fill out our form][community].

#### Step 2:

Take a look at our [coding guidelines][guidelines]. While adhering to every point of them is not mandatory, we'd like you to review them as those are the guidelines we use to develop our own sample applications to create a coherent experience.

#### Step 3:

Once you are ready to submit your application, [create a new issue][newissue] and choose `Template Submission`. Fill out the form that is pre-populated and submit your issue.

After that we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible with any questions we might have or the link to your application on [Code Exchange].

### 4. File issues with existing applications

As much as contributing code seems to be the most valuable way to contribute to any open-source project, having folks that find bugs, [create issues][newissue] and create detailed steps to replicate the bugs is one of the most crucial parts of open-source development.
